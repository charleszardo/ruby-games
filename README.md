# Ruby Games
Several Command Line games written in Ruby:

* Battleship
* Ghost
* Hangman
* Mastermind
* Minesweeper
* Memory Puzzle
* Sudoku
* Tic Tac Toe
* Word Chains

TODO
* Battleship - occasional bugs with computer AI
* Ghost - consider more complex DFS for best options for computer AI
* Memory - add cursor and ability to expand from "Match 2" to "Match n"
* Sudoku - Sudoku solver & add more functionality to user (allow users to "erase")
* Minesweeper - Add cursor, Implement ~~saving~~/loading w/ YAML and cursor UPDATE: saving working, need to clean up and finish implementing loading
* ARCADE - Create universal shell for all games.  Normalize shared classes (Player, Board, etc.).  Apply cursor, saving, etc. to all games.  Main menu for game selection.
  - Battleship, Chess, and Ghost currently are not working from main menu
